client : for frontend ( web Application) 
server: for backend (node API)

# web Application -> http request -> Node API

# we are using Express : most used pattern in express is MVC

# MVC 
 USER ->use -> CONTROLLER -> manipulates -> MODEL -> updates -> VIEW -> see -> USER 

# Folders inside server
1. models : for MVC
2. Routes : for different routers
   inside it : controllers : defines how we response to that specific route

# Folders in root 
1. client 
2. server

# It is a good practise to separate packages for both client and server
client => own package.json
server => own package.json
root => one package.json at the root level as well  

# always create package.json by : npm init
